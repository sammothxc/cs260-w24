        <p>
          RootRevolution put simply is a seed crowdfunder- the farmer friendly 
          fundraising website that the world has been waiting for. Inspired by 
          my family members who always have leftover seeds and don't know what 
          to do with them, RootRevolution is a crowdfunding-based website where 
          users with a surplus of seeds can donate their unsused seeds towards 
          any cause, whether it be a community-focused or a global movement. 
          That way, you can participate and be a part of something bigger 
          without having to donate costly supplies or spend lots of money. 
          RootRevolution connects you with anyone who has a need for seed, from 
          solo-sowers and school gardens to larger community and global 
          humanitarian organizations so that they can get the supplies they 
          need to make a difference in any way from simply teaching valuable 
          agricultural lessons or fighting hunger by providing food for those 
          who need it most.
