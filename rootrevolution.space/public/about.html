                RootRevolution put simply is a seed crowdfunder- the farmer friendly 
                fundraising website that the world has been waiting for. Inspired by 
                my family members who always have leftover seeds and don't know what 
                to do with them, RootRevolution is a crowdfunding-based website where 
                users with a surplus of seeds can donate their unsused seeds towards 
                any cause, whether it be a community-focused or a global movement. 
                That way, you can participate and be a part of something bigger 
                without having to donate costly supplies or spend lots of money. 
                RootRevolution connects you with anyone who has a need for seed, from 
                solo-sowers and school gardens to larger community and global 
                humanitarian organizations so that they can get the supplies they 
                need to make a difference in any way from simply teaching valuable 
                agricultural lessons or fighting hunger by providing food for those 
                who need it most.
